# Weather-web-app based on Dark sky API and google map API
1. Please download the source code and test it with a secuired domain that begins with "https" or your local host, the viretual server does not support the html5 geolocation function from google api.

2. The first page should be loading.php, and after the browser gets the user's current loation with latitude and longitude values (it may takes few seconds to get), then it will automatically redirect to the index of the app.

3. A search-for-location feature has been added, users are able to search for other places through the upper right searching bar, and it will show the current and weekly forecast of the desired location with high accuracy.

4. The app does not support safari yet which I will keep working on it, however, it works well on Chrome and Firefox

5. The app is based on media query responsive design which have different views on different devices.
